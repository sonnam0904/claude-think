## Overview

This privacy policy describes how the **Claude Think Tool** Dify plugin handles data and information. We are committed to protecting user privacy and ensuring full compliance with Dify Plugin Privacy Protection Guidelines.

## Data Collection

### ✅ No Personal Data Collection

**This plugin does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The plugin:
- Does not require user credentials, API keys, or authentication tokens
- Does not collect email addresses, usernames, or any user identifiers
- Does not track user behavior or usage patterns
- Does not access or read user files, databases, or external systems
- Does not make any external API calls or network requests

## Data Processing

### What Data is Processed?

The plugin processes **only** the following data:

1. **Thought Text**: Text strings provided by Node Agents through the `think` tool's `thought` parameter
   - This is structured reasoning text generated by AI agents, not user personal data
   - Examples: "Let me analyze the problem step by step...", "First, I need to consider..."

2. **Session Identifiers**: Internal session IDs used to scope thought storage
   - These are generated by Dify and used only for session management
   - Not linked to user identities

### How Data is Processed?

1. **In-Memory Storage**: Thoughts are stored temporarily in the plugin's runtime memory
2. **Session-Scoped**: Data is isolated per workflow session and automatically cleaned up
3. **No Persistence**: No data is written to disk, databases, or external storage
4. **No Transmission**: Data never leaves the plugin's runtime environment
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Session data is automatically deleted when sessions expire

### Data Retention

- **Duration**: Thoughts are retained only for the duration of the workflow session
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup occurs when:
  - The workflow session ends
  - The session expires (configurable timeout)
  - The plugin runtime restarts
- **No Backup**: No backup or archival of session data
